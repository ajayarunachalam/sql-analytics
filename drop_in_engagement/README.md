### The problem

You show up to work Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team walks over 
to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user engagement dashboards. 
You fire them up, and something immediately jumps out.

<chart omitted>*

The chart shows a steady rise of engagement from May, 2014, until August 1, 2014, where there was a sharp decline, 
followed by a plateau.

The job is to investigate the cause of this drop in engagement.

*The chart showed the number of engaged users each week. Yammer
defines engagement as having made some type of server call by interacting 
with the product (shown in the data as events of type “engagement”). Any point
in the chart can be interpreted as “the number of users who logged at least one engagement 
event during the week starting on that date.”
